# finbot
This project is a Python-based, interactive chatbot that uses a locally-run Large Language Model (LLaMA 3 via Ollama) to provide real-time stock market information, financial data, and interactive charts. It's designed to be a simple, cost-free, and powerful tool for financial analysis right on your desktop.
